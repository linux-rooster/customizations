# My Customizations
Well, here's some customizations for YOU to modify!\
You can grab any of them, and adjust them however you like!\
I will put more things here later.\
Currently, I have:\
## Neovim
A neovim init.lua, configured with the plugin manager "Packer", and the Neovim theme "Catppuccin Macchiato".\
Install Packer before getting the init.lua file.\
Make sure to run `:PackerSync` after getting the init.lua\
## Fastfetch
Neofetch is no longer being maintained. So i moved to fastfetch. I have a very simple config.\<br>
More descriptions coming soon..
