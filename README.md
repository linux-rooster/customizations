# My Customizations
Well, here's some customizations for YOU to modify!\
You can grab any of them, and adjust them however you like!\
I will put more things here later.\
Currently, I have:
## Neovim
A neovim init.lua, configured with the plugin manager "Packer", and the Neovim theme "Catppuccin Macchiato".\
Install Packer before getting the init.lua file.\
Make sure to run `:PackerSync` after getting the init.lua
## Fastfetch
Neofetch is no longer being maintained. So i moved to fastfetch. I have a very simple config.\
## Rofi
The best application launcher. Similar to fastfetch, my ROoi config is very simple.\
If you're using Wayland, i don't recommend using wofi <sup>1</sup>, as rofi-wayland is the same as rofi, but for Wayland.
> <sup>1</sup> Wofi is a similar launcher to Rofi, but i don't like it very much. For me, it was quite buggy.
