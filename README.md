# My Customizations
Well, here's some customizations for YOU to modify!\
You can grab any of them, and adjust them however you like!\
I will put more things here later.\
Currently, I have:
## Neovim
A neovim init.lua, configured with the plugin manager "Packer", and the Neovim theme "Catppuccin Mocha".\
Install Packer before getting the init.lua file.\
Make sure to run `:PackerSync` after getting the init.lua

## Fastfetch
Neofetch is no longer being maintained. So i moved to fastfetch. I have a very simple config.

## Wofi
The best application launcher for Wayland. Similar to fastfetch, my Wofi config is very simple.\
I like it. It's cleeeeeeeeeean.

## Oh My ZSH!
I use ZSH as my shell. It's very customizable. So i decided to put a simple arrow theme. Works best with Catppuccin-Mocha theme for your terminal.

## Kitty Terminal
One of my favourite terminal emulators. I left Konsole and moved on to kitty. I think i like it more. So here's my config.\
Make sure to install the Hack Nerd Font and Hack Nerd Font Bold from nerdfonts.com, as thats the font my config uses.

## CAVA
Cava (CROSS PLATFORM AUDIO VISUALIZER) is a terminal program that can be used to create audio spectrums. It can also be configured. Here's mine:

# THE BIG ONE: HYPRLAND (+ waybar)
HYprland is a tiling WM. I love customizing it. Heres my config, i think you might like it. PLease be sure to read the wayba and hyprland config thoroughly, because this config was meant for MY system.\
Now this has many tools that you need to install because i'm too lazy to make an install script for my dotfiles.
- `grim` and `slurp` for screenshotting
- `waybar` for the top bar
- `thunar` for the file manager
- `wofi` for the app launcher
- `kitty` for the terminal
- `swww` for the wallpaper utility
- `wlogout` for the logout menu (waybar)
- Bibata-Modern-Classic's both XCURSOR and HYPRCURSOR themes
